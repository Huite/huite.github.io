# Windows

Life is much easier with a package manager. Fortunately, Windows has useable
package managers now as well. [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) works well.

Open PowerShell and run:

```{.console}
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression
```

# macOS

Open shell and run:

```{.console}
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Add homebrew binary directory to path

```{.nu}
$env.PATH = ($env.PATH | append ["/opt/homebrew/bin"])
```
