# Windows

Life is much easier with a package manager. Fortunately, Windows has useable
package managers now as well. [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) works well.

See the [Install instructions](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Install) for
installing to a custom location, which is desirable for Windows 11 dev. I've mapped
the dev drive to `Z:\`.

Open PowerShell and run:

```{.console}
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
irm get.scoop.sh -outfile 'install.ps1'
.\install.ps1 -ScoopDir 'Z:\scoop' -ScoopGlobalDir 'Z:\scoop\global' -NoProxy
```

# macOS

Open shell and run:

```{.console}
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Add homebrew binary directory to path

```{.nu}
$env.PATH = ($env.PATH | append ["/opt/homebrew/bin"])
```
