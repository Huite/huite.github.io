The latest installer from SourceForge doesn't seem to work.

Use the latest release from https://winlibs.com instead.

Pick the latest version from UCRT runtime with POSIX threads for 64-bit.

At the time of writing: 

UCRT runtime
GCC 14.2.0 (with POSIX threads) + LLVM/Clang/LLD/LLDB 19.1.1 + MinGW-w64 12.0.0 UCRT - release 2   (LATEST)

Notes: 

- UCRT (Universal C Runtime): This is newer and recommended for Windows 10/11
- MSVCRT (Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime): The older runtime, maintained for compatibility
- POSIX threads are more standard than MCF threads
