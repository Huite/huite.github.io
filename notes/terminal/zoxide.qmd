description: A nicer cd

Zoxide remembers which directories are visited most frequently and jumps to
them.

Run:

```{.console}
scoop install zoxide
```

In `config.nu`, add:

```{.console}
# Initialize zoxide
zoxide init nushell | save -f ($nu.default-config-dir | path join 'zoxide.nu')

# Source the zoxide config
source ($nu.default-config-dir | path join 'zoxide.nu')
```
