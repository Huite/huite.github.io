It's a perfectly adequate Chromium browser.

I've mostly followed this blogpost before: https://thomask.sdf.org/blog/2023/03/18/the-dark-defaults-of-microsoft-edge.html

# Language

Click the cog and set language to English (United States).

# Extensions

- Bitwarden
- uBlock Origin
- Surfingkeys (seems to work better than Vimium for me)

# Settings

- Profiles / Microsoft Rewards: turn off
- Privacy, Search, and Services: turn off all services
- Address bar and search / Search suggestions and filters: turn off "Show me search and site suggestions using my typed characters" and "Show me suggestions from history, favourites and other data on this device using my typed characters
"
- Languages: turn off "Text prediction", turn off "Enable grammar and spellcheck assistance"

# Vertical tabs

Click the "Tab actions menu" and "Turn on vertical tabs".
